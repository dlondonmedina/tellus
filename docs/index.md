# The Story

Afterwards, most experts claimed they were shocked by the rate at which human civilization collapsed. The cynics among them were quick to celebrate their grim predictions coming true, but found little comfort in a lost world. What semblance of social order was left after The Crisis quickly crumbled in The Panic that followed. While nations had stockpiled massive strategic fuel reserves more basic and less profitable resources were neglected. Water quickly ran out in many regions and people abandoned these uninhabitable zones. Many did not make the journey, and yet the mass migrations quickly rendered the old national borders irrelevant.

Nations who had thought themselves powerful, fell. Remnant factions of the old governments attempted to maintain order and provide services to the populations they could still reach. Most people collected into small communities and the city-state returned as the main form of human organization. Going back was difficult. People had forgotten how to grow food, build shelter, and provide the basics in a specialized advanced society.

Your party emerges and has gained a small number of followers. You hear that there are several other parties in nearby regions, and you imagine that perhaps society can be rebuilt...

## Chapter 1

Before The Crisis, land of Dylandia had been as near to a paradise as human civilization had ever seen. The government was just, if not slow moving. Dylandians were hospitable but proud. Quick to invite a stranger into their homes, but equally quick to kick that stranger out again if they gave offense.

Through the middle of the land runs a vast mountain chain with peaks towering above the plains to the east and the forests to the west. In the mountains, the people had built geothermal power plants to provide the electricity that the people needed. The mountains also provided the raw materials to produce various technologies from steel plows to computers. Before The Crisis, factories had been build on the shoulders of the lower peaks, but during the Panic, most of the people fled. A visiter to those factories these days would find only haunted ruins, or worse. Bands of scavengers now roam the cracked roads and paths that thread their way delicately through the passes. The power plants remain, but they are controlled by brigands and outlaws; the few who got rich during The Panic.

Once, before humans began domineering the land, vast forests stretched west of the mountains to the western Sea. For the need of lumber, most of them were cleared in the 100 years leading up to The Crisis. Trees that stood for thousands of years were replaced by fast growing tree plantations and suburbs. Efficiency and progress was the cry of westward expansion. If The Crisis brought any good to the world, it was to the natural world. In the years since The Panic subsided, the forests have begun to regrow, but perhaps humankind will not be around to see a rebalancing of nature. This is up to you.

East of the mountains large prairies existed since the beginning times. Human progress turned most of them to crop lands, and the vast fields grew all the food the nations could need. Dylandian farmland was so productive that the people traded their surplus with nations across the sea. Even after The Panic, this land remained fertile, if not so productive as it had before. While crops could still be grown, the people hoarded their produce in vast stockpiles. Even if supply routes hadn't been cut, it's unlikely that the farmers would've shared with their neighbors, or "outsiders" as they called them.

Far in the south and north of Dylandia, metropolises had been built. In the south, government was established and effectively organized all of Dylandia around common principles of economic liberty and individual responsibility. Incidentally, The Panic took hold strongest in regions where individualism was a paramount value, and the southern city fell in a week. Well, it didn't fall so much as it was torn apart from within. One unfortunate man was largely to blame for this. Tony Drumb inherited an arms manufacturing empire from his father. Drumb was mocked relentlessly throughout his early life for his name and his inherited wealth. By the time he was 15, he had changed his name to Anthony Power, an equally ridiculous name, and learned to manipulate the crowds. Most were enthralled by his particular brand of braggadocio and Power became one of the cool kids. Power also learned to cow those who resisted into submission with fairly unsophisticated bullying. The few who were above both his boasts and bullying he flattered incessantly, leaving very few outside his sway.

Power mastered the arts of manipulation by the time he cheated his way through university. He was lounging in his gold plated estate--he had a thing for gold--when The Crisis hit. A tackily dressed server clattered in on high heels carrying a phone.

"Talk to me," Power barked as he pushed the answer button.

"My liege, it's happened. The capitol building has fallen" replied a voice on the line.

"I know it. Start phase 3 of our campaign. I wanna see my guns in every house in the country by the end of the week and make sure people pay for the 'Freedom' subscription for ammo."

"It will be so."

If it hadn't been for Phase 3, the society of Dylandia might have recovered. While the capitol building had fallen, most of the government survived. Buildings can be rebuilt. If there are historians in the future, they'll remember that Phase 3 sparked The Panic, and proved pretty definitively that frightened humans should not be given free firearms with the purchase of an unlimited ammunition subscription. Power's firearms were in every house in the city within days of The Crisis, and the city tore itself apart within a week. After the fall of the Southern City, Power left to his safe haven in the mountains and while his products still circulate--better than most commodities--he has not been heard from since The Panic.

While the great Southern City had been the seat of government prior to The Crisis, the Northern City was a center for healthcare and social programs. This infrastructure was concentrated in the Northern City because it was the site of several large research universities. The Northern City was spared the strife spurred on by Power's nefarious schemes. In general, the Northern City was insulated from the immediate fallout of The Crisis and the subsequent terror of The Panic. However, by the time of The Crisis, the city had atrophied. The leaders of the city and the major institutions had grown old, their programs no longer relevant to the advancing world. Most of the denizens of Dylandia saw the institutions as obsolete and out of touch. Moreover, young folks were no longer interested in the long slow careers available in the Northern City. They could earn more in the Southern City as politicians and lobbyists or in the mountains as technologists.

As we embark on our story, the Council of Dylandia finds itself exiled to the outskirts of the Southern City. They lost their place as the capitol fell to rioters and revolutionaries. They remain stuck in exile and hiding until they've achieved sufficient public support to return.

After The Panic, The Food Mafia No Rats attempted to gain control of the great plains. Through strong arm tactics and protection networks, they've established a feeble organization to collect surplus food, but they lack the technology to reasonably distribute or preserve it. They also need medical and social programs to stop diseases, once cured, from decimating among the population. The people also resent the heavy handed control exerted by The Food Mafia and many farms refuse to contribute.

In the Northern City, a remaining band of young doctors and educators attempt to re-establish a university and infrastructure to provide healthcare. Unfortunately, they find it nearly impossible to recruit the various experts and potential students who scattered during The Panic. Without sufficient human resources, it will be impossible for them to provide the critical healthcare and education to support the mental and physical health of a future society.

In the wilds of the West, IHOP, International House of Peace, reigns supreme (and enjoys tasty tasty breakfasts). They control the natural resources that will be necessary for infrastructure to be rebuild. While the mountains are overrun by brigands and scavengers, members of IHOP hold some sway for their promise of amnesty and peace for all people. With some negotiation tactics, perhaps they can get trade through the passes.

## Chapter 2

Meanwhile in the land of Gilead, humanity was also on the brink. While Dylandia spanned a vast continent, Gilead was a relatively small region. To the West, untracked mountains rose to unsurmountable heights. Even before The Crisis and The Panic, most people who wished to reach the nations to the West flew above or sailed around. There were no roads or paths through the high mountain passes. The Western range was one of the few unexplored regions of the planet. Gilead's culture was ancient, and the original forests had already been lost for centuries by the time The Crisis hit. Even the farmland had been mostly developed. The pre-Panic nation of Gilead had relied heavily on importing food and other resources from across the Western Range or across the Eastern Sea. In exchange, Gilead had provided culture, government, and technology.

The Crisis eliminated more than half the population of Gilead. Despite the great suffering, the nation didn't collapse into the chaos of the Panic. The government dissolved and infrastructure disintegrated, but the people who survived turned to each other. With the vastly reduced population, the farmland that hadn't been turned into shopping malls and suburbs produced barely enough to sustain the population, but people became hungry and grim. While the Panic overran Dylandia like a wildfire, it sank Gilead into a deep depression.

On the edge of the Eastern Sea, Gileadites created a central hub of their shipping empire. Since they relied so heavily on imported resources, controlling the seas was central to their survival. The navy worked closely with merchant marines and logistics professionals to keep ships running, carrying goods between the nations and continents. Gileadite logistics were so reliable that other nations had contracted with Gilead to manage their trade routes. These routes withstood the initial period of The Crisis, but as The Panic gripped nations, the sailors refused to sail, and even if they had been willing, fuel shortages ended most trade.

Roads used to lead from the hub on the Eastern Sea to the capitol in the center of the nation. Gilead's government had been built on the principle of stability at all costs. Decision making happened slowly and deliberately. Decision-makers were not subject to the whims of the mob, and instead were appointed by regional representatives. There was little room for dissent because decisions were handed down from the Council, but the people across the nation valued the stability and had little reason to dissent. As a result, as long as the central government served as an ordering standard, society functioned well. Since the Crisis, the capitol froze. The Council no longer made decisions, and the stability crumbled.

In the Northeast, institutions had been built to support healthcare and scientific discovery. People interested in this field could go to these institutions and receive a free education in exchange for service to the state in the healthcare field. As a result, Gilead's healthcare system was the envy of the world. If residents of Dylandia, or Blefuscu often travelled to Gilead to receive treatment for the most difficult diseases. Gilead was wealthy enough to provide medical services for free. Now the institutions have fallen into disarray. Healthcare workers no longer receiving support from the central government began private practices in which they extorted high fees from sick folks.

While the Western Range was untracked, and few ventured above the foothills, many towns were built in the mineral rich foothills. Natural fuels that powered the shipping empire could be found in the mountains, and the central government built companies and networks to extract and transport these fuels to the Eastern Sea where they were used in shipping or exported to other nations. After the fall of the government and decimation of the workforce in the Crisis, these valuable regions were largely abandoned. Few remained, but for society to return there would need to be renaissance of industry. At the same time, there were concerns across the globe about the use of the fuels that were abundant in the Western Range.

Group one finds itself in the foothills of the Western Range. It is on them to convince people to return to the region so that the engine of the economy can be re-ignite. But they have to do so in a way that prevents another crisis of the environmental variety.

Group two is in the North East. While many of the healthcare workers went private, these idealists imagine a return to centralized healthcare for the nation and the world. This had been supported by a centralized government, but perhaps a new system can be built that is equally equitable and does not depend on the instructions from the government. Before anything can happen, though, healthcare workers need to return and commit to healthcare as a human right.

Group three represents the remaining architects of the infrastructure and logistics empire on the Eastern Sea. While fuel is short, the more critical problem to reestablish trade is labor shortages. Few people are willing to sail the post-Panic seas, and the only way for trade to return is to recruit a new army of sailors, merchant marines, logisticians, and others.

Group four finds itself the remnant government. Much of their faith in past governments has been shaken. The only hope for the land and its people is for these individuals to help organize the people across the small nation and re-establish ties, and more importantly trade, with neighbors across the sea.
